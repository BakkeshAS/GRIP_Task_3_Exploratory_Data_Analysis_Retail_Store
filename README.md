# GRIP_Task_3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Retail_Store

DataSet: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

Tool Used: Power BI  

The data is imported into PowerBI using getdata functionality.   load and transform option is selected to do a quick analysis of the data loaded.  

The column quality confirms that there are no error values in the data.   The datatype of all the columns is as required.  

In the data section the decimal points and currency type of columns sales and profit is updated to 2 decimal points and currency to $ respectively.  
In the model section two hierarchies are created such as Location and segment.   

There are three reports in the report section such as Highest performer, shipment, and Segment.  

All the reports follow similar master layout.   

Super store operates in all the states of the United States of America. The data shows that service is provided to a total of 49 states covering a sum of 531 cities, accounting for 37,873 item sales, with a profit of $0.28 million.  

Each state belongs to one of the regions viz. West, East, South and Central. Matrix viz shows that Profits from west is highest contributor to the total profit of the company like wise profits from central region contributes the least. There are a few states which are showing negative figures that are in common brackets such as Colorado and Arizona in west region. Texas has recorded a huge loss of $25,729 which comes under central region. A detailed investigation needs to be conducted to analyse the losses to derive the strategies and lift the state out of loss-making pool. And similar managerial decisions need to be done to curb the total losses of $98,247.  

Shipment report sheds light on four different modes of shipment offered to customers and the corresponding profit gained, respectively. Standard Class shipment mode is winner with 22,797 items delivered to 49 states and 454 cities with a whooping profit of $.16 million. First class delivery, same day delivery, and second-class delivery are not at all utilized by the consumers in a few states observed in the map, competitive pricing and or discounts needs to be offered to promote these modes of shipments.  

Coming to segments report.  
Consumer, corporate and home office are the three main segments covered by the superstore. All these are further sub categorised as Technology, office supplies, and Furniture. Consumer products are delivered to 47 out of 49 states like wise if we further drill into each category and subcategory a few states are yet to be included in sales and service area. (….A pause….) This leaves the company strategy team to work on the market share and devise a plan to increase it.
